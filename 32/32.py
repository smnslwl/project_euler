   We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all
   the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is
   1 through 5 pandigital.

   The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
   multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

   Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
   identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

   HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to
   only include it once in your sum.
